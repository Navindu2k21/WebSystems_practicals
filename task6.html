        //what is the difference between an array and an object?
        const explanation = `Task 6\nAn array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations and is ordered by index, allowing for easy access via numerical indices. An object, on the other hand, is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is a string (or symbol) that maps to a value, allowing for more complex data structures and relationships. Arrays are typically used for lists of items, while objects are used to represent entities with properties.`;

        //why are arrays and objects often used together?
        const reason = `\n\nArrays and objects are often used together because they complement each other in organizing and managing data. Arrays can hold multiple objects, allowing for the representation of collections of related entities (e.g., a list of students, where each student is an object with properties like name and age). This combination enables developers to efficiently store, access, and manipulate complex data structures, making it easier to perform operations such as filtering, mapping, and reducing data sets.`;

        //what was the most challenging part of this lab?
        const challenge = `\n\nThe most challenging part of this lab was understanding how to effectively use higher-order functions like map, filter, and reduce to manipulate arrays of objects. It required a solid grasp of both array methods and object structures to implement the desired functionality correctly. Additionally, ensuring that the data was accessed and displayed properly in the HTML output added an extra layer of complexity. However, overcoming these challenges provided valuable insights into JavaScript's capabilities for handling complex data.`;
